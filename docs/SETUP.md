# Setting up Yosemite Kids, step by step

This guide assumes **no technical background**. It takes about 20 minutes:
ten for the TV, five for your phone, five to pair them and add channels.

> **Yosemite Kids is in beta.** The setup below is the well-trodden path, but some
> newer features are still being confirmed across different phones, tablets and
> TVs — expect the occasional rough edge. Your channels and settings are stored
> on the devices themselves, not in the cloud, so keep in mind that uninstalling
> the app throws them away.

Yosemite Kids isn't in any app store (see the README for why), so you install it
by "sideloading" — which just means installing an app from a file instead of
from a store. Millions of people do this; the only catch is that Android makes
you flip a permission switch first.

**What you need:**

- Your Google TV / Android TV device (Chromecast with Google TV, or a TV
  running Google TV)
- The parent's Android phone
- Both on the same home Wi-Fi

## Part 1 — Install Yosemite Kids on the TV

You'll use the free **Downloader** app — no computer needed.

First, two one-time preparations — doing them now means the install later
runs straight through without security interruptions:

1. On the TV, open the **Play Store** and search for **Downloader by
   AFTVnews** (orange icon). Install it.
2. Flip the permission switch for it: go to **Settings → Apps → Security &
   Restrictions → Unknown sources** (on some TVs: **Settings → Privacy →
   Security & Restrictions**), find **Downloader** in the list and turn it
   **on**. This tells the TV "apps this app downloads are allowed to
   install" — it's the switch every sideload needs, and it only appears in
   the list *after* Downloader is installed, which is why it's step 2.

Now the install itself:

3. Open Downloader. The first time, it asks for permission to access
   files — allow it.
4. In Downloader's URL box, type the address of the newest build:

   ```
   github.com/mrain1p/yosemite-kids/releases/latest/download/yosemite-kids.apk
   ```

   The download starts straight away and asks to install.
5. Press **Install**. (If instead the TV says *"your TV is not allowed to
   install unknown apps from this source"*, step 2 was missed — press
   **Settings** right on that message, turn Downloader **on**, go back, and
   the install screen returns.)
6. Done — Yosemite Kids appears in your TV's app row. Keep Downloader: a
   newer build is installed the same way, over the top, and keeps everything
   you set up.

## Part 2 — Install Yosemite Kids on the parent's phone

You'll see two security prompts along the way — both are the standard
Android ritual for *any* app installed outside a store, not something wrong.

1. On the phone, open this address in Chrome — the download starts
   immediately:
   **github.com/mrain1p/yosemite-kids/releases/latest/download/yosemite-kids.apk**
2. Chrome warns the file "might be harmful" (prompt one — it says this for
   every APK): tap **Download anyway**.
3. Open the downloaded file (notification shade, or Files → Downloads).
4. Android asks to allow Chrome (or Files) to install unknown apps (prompt
   two): allow it, then press **Install**.
5. Open Yosemite Kids. It looks empty — that's right, nothing is allowed yet.

If a kid has their own phone or tablet, install Yosemite Kids on it the same way.

## Part 3 — Pair the phone with the TV

1. On the **TV**: open Yosemite Kids and press the **⚙ settings** icon (top
   right). A **QR code** appears.
2. On the **phone**: open the normal camera app and point it at the QR
   code. Tap the link that pops up — Yosemite Kids opens and asks
   *"Pair with …?"* — confirm.
3. That's it. The **first phone to pair becomes the admin** automatically.
   (Any phone that scans later needs your approval on the first phone, so a
   visitor photographing your TV gains nothing.)

Everything from here is done on the phone, in **Yosemite Kids → ⚙ →** (it asks
for your fingerprint, or a parent PIN you set on first use).

## Part 4 — First-time setup on the phone

Do these in order; each pushes to the TV automatically when you press
**Save & close**.

1. **Add channels** — under *Channels & playlists*, search a channel your
   kid loves and tap **Add**. Repeat. (Or browse the in-app **Suggested
   channels** directory for ready-vetted picks, or import an exported
   `whitelist.txt` file — see the [whitelists folder](../whitelists/) for
   themed lists in that format.)
2. **Add your kids** — under *Kids*, tap **Add your first kid**: name, age,
   a color and an avatar. The age matters if you use AI screening later.
   With **one** kid the app looks unchanged; adding a **second** kid brings
   the "Who's watching?" screen on the TV.
3. **Screen time** — pick a kid, set session length, sessions per
   weekday/weekend, and bedtime. **Copy rules from** a sibling saves typing.
4. **Optional — lock a profile**: Kids → Edit → **Set code**. The code is
   four presses of the remote's arrows/OK button, entered blind (only dots
   show on the TV) — so a younger sibling can't pick an older kid's profile.
5. **Optional — AI screening**: under *AI content screening*, pick a
   provider, paste an API key, write your house rules in plain words. New
   videos are checked per kid's age before kids can see them, and the first
   time a video is pressed it gets a **deep check** of its description, tags
   and transcript before it plays. Anything the AI is unsure about waits for
   your OK under *Waiting for your OK*; anything it blocks is listed under
   *Blocked videos*, where Allow overrules it.

   Need different rules for one channel? Tap 📝 next to it under *Channels &
   playlists* and write them there ("only the engineering builds — no prank
   videos"). They apply to that channel only, on top of the family rules.

   Don't have a key yet? Pick one provider and get a key from it — you only
   need one:

   - **OpenRouter** (recommended — one key, works with lots of models,
     usually cheapest to start): go to
     [openrouter.ai/settings/keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys),
     sign up, click **Create Key**, add a few dollars of credit, copy the
     key (starts with `sk-or-`).
   - **OpenAI**: go to
     [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys),
     sign up, click **Create new secret key**, copy it (starts with `sk-`).
     You'll need billing set up under *Settings → Billing*.
   - **Anthropic**: go to
     [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys),
     sign up, click **Create Key**, copy it (starts with `sk-ant-`). Add
     credit under *Plans & Billing*.
   - **Gemini**: go to
     [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), sign
     in with a Google account, click **Create API key**, copy it. Gemini has
     a free tier, so this is the only option that may cost nothing.

   Whichever you pick, paste the key into the **API key** field in Yosemite Kids
   right after tapping that provider's button — the key never leaves your
   phone and TV except to talk directly to that provider.
6. Press **Save & close** — the phone pushes everything to the TV and shows
   "Synced ✓".

**Check it worked:** both screens show the same settings fingerprint
(`Settings #a1b2c3d4`) — TV: ⚙ screen; phone: under *Kid devices*. Matching
numbers = provably in sync.

## Everyday things

- **Give bonus time:** ⚙ → *Screen time today* → pick the kid → **Grant**.
- **Stop everything today:** ⚙ → **Pause for today** (Resume undoes it).
- **See what's playing / today's minutes:** ⚙ → *Kid devices* → **Stats** —
  works even while the TV is off (it shows the last report).
- **Approve a download** the kid requested: ⚙ → *Offline downloads*.
- **Updates:** ⚙ → *App* → **Check for updates** — installs new releases
  from inside the app; no more sideloading after the first time.

## If something doesn't work

- **TV shows "offline" on the phone** — open Yosemite Kids on the TV (the
  pairing service runs while the app is open) and check both devices are on
  the same Wi-Fi, then try again.
- **Channels look thin right after changing AI rules or kids' ages** — the
  catalog is being re-checked against the new rules; tiles reappear as the
  AI clears them (minutes, not hours).
- **A kid's videos stopped resolving app-wide** — usually a YouTube-side
  change; check the
  [open issues](https://github.com/mrain1p/yosemite-kids/issues) — a fix
  build typically follows within days, installed the same way as the first.
