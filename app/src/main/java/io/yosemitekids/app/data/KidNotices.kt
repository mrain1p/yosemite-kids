/**
 * Kid-facing lines caused by something a parent just did from their phone:
 * bonus minutes, a rules edit, a timeout lifted. Without them the parent has
 * to say it out loud ("I gave you fifteen more"), and until the kid tries to
 * play something the device quietly contradicts what they were told.
 *
 * Nothing is queued. A message emitted while no Yosemite Kids screen is collecting
 * is dropped, not replayed the next time the app opens — a bonus announced an
 * hour late reads as a glitch, and the rules themselves are visible wherever
 * the kid looks anyway.
