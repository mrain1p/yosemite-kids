 * instantly, then passes at most one repeat per [intervalMs], swallowing the
 * rest; releases and taps are never touched, so deliberate single steps stay
 * instant. Applies only to [keys]; harmless on touch devices (no key events).
 *
 * The pacing matters most for *backward* motion (left/up): the pivot keeps the
 * focused tile near the leading edge, so almost nothing is pre-composed behind
 * it and every backward step must compose its target synchronously — at the raw
 * repeat rate that composition can't keep up and focus visibly sticks.

 * as a deliberate press: the menu appears and instantly picks its first row.
 * Swallowing the release at the tile can't help, because by then the tile is no
 * longer the focus owner and never sees it.
 *
 * So the menu ignores select entirely until the remote has been let go. A
 * fresh press — [android.view.KeyEvent.getRepeatCount] back at 0, which the
 * tail of an in-flight hold can never produce — opens the gate and passes
 * through, so the first *intentional* press still works with no dead period.
 * Put this on an ancestor of whatever the menu focuses: previews run from the
 * root down, so it sees the event before the button does.
