/**
 * Phone-side memory for the weekly digest.
 *
 * The stats payload already carries per-day minutes (SessionGuard's history),
 * but channel totals are lifetime cumulative — "most watched this week" needs
 * a baseline to diff against. So every time the phone caches a device's stats
 * it also records that day's channel totals here; a week later the difference
 * between today's lifetime numbers and the row from seven days ago is exactly
 * the week's viewing.
 *
 * One file per device token, newest-last rows of {day, channels}. Same-day
 * records overwrite (the row is "totals as of the end of that day"), and only
 * the last [KEEP_DAYS] rows are kept.
